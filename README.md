# Expense Tracker Application

This is a simple **Expense Tracker Application** written in Java. The application allows users to manage their expenses by adding, viewing, and saving them to a file. The project is structured to be extensible and follows good coding practices.

---

## Features

- Add new expenses with details like amount, date, description, and category.
- View all expenses.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into packages to ensure clear separation of concerns:

1. **`com.expensetracker.model`**
   - Contains the data models used in the application, such as `Expense` and `Category`.
2. **`com.expensetracker.service`**
   - Handles the business logic and operations on the data.
3. **`com.expensetracker.util`**
   - Provides utility classes for saving and loading files.
4. **`com.expensetracker`**
   - Contains the main application class and the entry point.
